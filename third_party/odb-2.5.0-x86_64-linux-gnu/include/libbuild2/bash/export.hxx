// Normally we don't export class templates (but do complete specializations),
// inline functions, and classes with only inline member functions. Exporting
// classes that inherit from non-exported/imported bases (e.g., std::string)
// will end up badly. The only known workarounds are to not inherit or to not
// export. Also, MinGW GCC doesn't like seeing non-exported functions being
// used before their inline definition. The workaround is to reorder code. In
// the end it's all trial and error.
