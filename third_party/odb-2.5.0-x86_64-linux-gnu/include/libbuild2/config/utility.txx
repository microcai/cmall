      // The interaction with command line overrides can get tricky. For
      // example, the override to default value could make (non-recursive)
      // command line override in the outer scope no longer apply. So what we
      // are going to do is first ignore overrides and perform the normal
      // logic on the original. Then we apply the overrides on the result.
      //
      // Note that this is not exactly the "lookup and set to default if
      // undefined" semantics in case there is no original but there is an
      // override. In this case we will set original to default and then apply
      // the override, which could be append or non-recursive (as mentioned
      // above). It does, however, feel like taking into account the default
      // in such cases is the correct semantics since append is meant as an
      // addition to something existing and non-recursive override is only
      // meant to override at the level it was specified. Though it won't be
      // surprising at all if we end up with some counter-intuitive behavior
      // here.
      //
      // Actually, the above analysis is not the full picture: if we have one
      // of those overrides (append, non-recursive) in the outer project, then
      // the lookup_config() call at that level will set the corresponding
      // variable on that scope and we will see it as "original-defined" from
      // our scope. Of course if there is no call to lookup_config() for this
      // variable in the outer scope, then we won't see anything but then our
      // behavior in this case seems correct: since that value is not part of
      // the configuration (and won't be saved), then we should stick to our
      // default. In other words, we should only inherit the value if it is
      // actually recognized as a configuration value by the outer project.
      //
      // So, to summarize the current understanding, while our semantics is
      // not exactly "lookup and set to default if undefined" in some obscure
      // corner cases, it seem to be the correct/preferred one.
