Prerequisites
=============

  - libodb           http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/
  - Boost            http://www.boost.org


Building on UNIX
================

The following build instructions are for the Linux/UNIX/Mac OS X
operating systems as well as for Cygwin and MinGW on Windows.

The standard autotools-based build system is used on these platforms.
After unpacking the source code archive, change to the libodb-boost
package directory (referred to as libodb-boost/ from now on) and run
the configure script:

./configure

To see the available configuration options run configure with --help:

./configure --help

The configure script expects the libodb and Boost headers and libraries
to be installed in a directory where the C++ compiler and linker will
search for them by default (normally /usr and /usr/local). If these
libraries are installed in other directories, you can use the CPPFLAGS
and LDFLAGS configure variables to specify their locations, for example:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/libodb/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/libodb/lib

If these libraries are not installed and you would like to use their
build directories instead, you can use the --with-libodb, and
--with-boost configure options to specify their locations, for example:

./configure --with-boost=/tmp/boost

For the Boost build directory the configure script expects to find the
Boost libraries in the stage/lib/ subdirectory.

As another example, the following configure command only builds shared
libraries, uses the specified C++ compiler, and compiles with optimization
and without debug information:

./configure --disable-static CXX=g++-4.5 CXXFLAGS=-O3

Once configuration is complete, run make to build libodb-boost:

make

Once the build is completed successfully, you can install the libodb-boost
headers and libraries using the install target (you may need to do this
step as root depending on the installation directory):

make install


Building on Windows
===================

The following build instructions are for Windows using Microsoft Visual
Studio. If you would like to build libodb-boost with GCC either using
Cygwin or MinGW, refer to the "Building on UNIX" section above.

The standard Visual Studio project and solution files are used on this
platform. The provided project files expect the libodb and Boost header
and import library directories to be in the VC++ Directories Include and
Library search lists. For libodb, see the INSTALL file in the package
directory for more information on how to setup the VC++ Directories. For
Boost, refer to the Boost documentation.

To build libodb-boost, unpack the source code archive and open the
libodb-boost-vc<N>.sln file located in the libodb-boost package
directory (referred to as libodb-boost\ from now on). Here <N> is the
version of Visual Studio that you are using. Once the solution is open,
select the desired build configuration (Debug or Release) and platform
(Win32 or x64) and build the solution.

The resulting 32-bit DLLs and import libraries are placed into the
libodb-boost\bin\ and libodb-boost\lib\ directories, respectively.
Similarly, the 64-bit DLLs and import libraries are placed into
libodb-boost\bin64\ and libodb-boost\lib64\. The Release versions of
the import libraries are named odb-boost.lib and the Debug versions
are named odb-boost-d.lib.

To configure Visual Studio to automatically locate the libodb-boost
headers, DLLs, and import libraries, add the following paths to your
VC++ Directories:

Win32:

  Include:    ...\libodb-boost
  Library:    ...\libodb-boost\lib
  Executable: ...\libodb-boost\bin

x64:

  Include:    ...\libodb-boost
  Library:    ...\libodb-boost\lib64
  Executable: ...\libodb-boost\bin64
