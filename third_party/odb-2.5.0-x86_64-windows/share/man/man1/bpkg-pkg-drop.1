.SH NAME
\fBbpkg-pkg-drop\fR \- drop package
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBbpkg pkg-drop\fR|\fBdrop\fR [\fIoptions\fR] <pkg>\.\.\.\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBpkg-drop\fR command drops one or more packages from the configuration\.
If the packages being dropped still have dependent packages, then those will
have to be dropped as well and you will be prompted to confirm\. And if the
packages being dropped have dependency packages that would otherwise no longer
be used, then they will be dropped as well unless the
\fB--keep-unused\fR|\fB-K\fR\fR option is specified\.
.PP
The \fBpkg-drop\fR command also supports several options (described below)
that allow you to control the amount of work that will be done\.
.SH "PKG-DROP OPTIONS"

\fB--print-only|-p\fR\.
