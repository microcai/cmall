.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBrelease\fR command manages the project's version during the release\.
Specifically, it first changes the snapshot version to the corresponding
release version in each project package's \fBmanifest\fR file, commits these
changes (unless \fB--no-commit\fR is specified), tags this commit (unless
\fB--no-tag\fR is specified), and, if \fB--push\fR is specified, pushes the
changes to the remote\. Unless \fB--no-open\fR is specified, the \fBrelease\fR
command then opens the next development cycle by changing the version to a
snapshot, committing these changes (unless \fB--no-commit\fR is specified),
and, if \fB--push\fR is specified, pushing them to the remote\. Note that
committing, tagging, and pushing is currently only supported for \fBgit(1)\fR
project repositories\.
.PP
The \fBrelease\fR command can also be used to release a new package revision
by passing the \fB--revision\fR option\. In this mode \fBrelease\fR increments
the current version's revision component in each project package's
\fBmanifest\fR file, commits these changes (unless \fB--no-commit\fR is
specified), tags this commit (unless \fB--no-tag\fR is specified), and, if
\fB--push\fR is specified, pushes the changes to the remote\. In this mode
\fBrelease\fR can be optionally instructed to update an existing tag for the
current version to point to the latest revision (\fB--current-tag=update\fR)
or to remove it (\fB--current-tag=remove\fR)\.
.PP
When releasing a revision, the project's repository index is expected to
already contain other changes since for a revision all the associated changes,
including to version, must belong to a single commit\. Alternatively, a
revision can be released by amending one or more existing commits using the
\fB--amend\fR and \fB--squash\fR options\. In this case the index may still
contain additional changes but is not required to\.
.PP
The \fBrelease\fR command also has a number of \fIcontinue modes\fR that allow
the completion of steps that were previously suppressed with the \fB--no-*\fR
options in the above main modes\. These are \fB--tag\fR which tags the release
commit and, if \fB--push\fR is specified, pushes it to the remote as well as
\fB--open\fR which performs the opening of the next development cycle as
described above\.
.PP
In all the modes that perform a commit, if the project's repository index
already contains other changes, then the commit message is automatically
opened for editing unless \fB--no-edit\fR is specified\. The editing of the
commit message in the absence of other changes can be requested with the
\fB--edit\fR option\.
.PP
Normally, \fBrelease\fR operates on all the packages in a project\. If no
project directory is specified, then the current working directory is assumed
and all the packages are released, even if the current directory is a package
directory\. If, however, one or more package directories are specified
explicitly with \fB--directory\fR|\fB-d\fR\fR, then \fBrelease\fR assumes you
know what you are doing and only releases these packages\. All the packages
being released must have the same version but may have different revisions\.
.SH "RELEASE OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB--revision\fR"
Release a new package revision instead of a new version\.
.IP "\fB--no-commit\fR"
Don't commit the changes\. Implies \fB--no-tag\fR and, in the version release
mode, \fB--no-open\fR\.
.IP "\fB--no-tag\fR"
Don't tag the release commit\. Tagging can be performed later using the
\fB--tag\fR mode option\.
.IP "\fB--tag\fR"
Tag the already released version instead of releasing a new one\.
.IP "\fB--current-tag\fR \fIaction\fR"
Specify what to do with an existing tag for the current version when tagging a
new revision\. Valid values for this option are \fBkeep\fR (default),
\fBupdate\fR, and \fBremove\fR\.
.IP "\fB--push\fR"
Push the committed changes and tags to the remote\.
.IP "\fB--show-push\fR"
Print the push command instead of executing it\. This allows examining the
committed changes and tags before pushing them to the remote\. Note that the
command is printed to \fBstdout\fR\.
.IP "\fB--no-open\fR"
Don't open the next development cycle\. Opening can be performed later using
the \fB--open\fR mode option\.
.IP "\fB--open\fR"
Open the next development cycle instead of releasing a new version\.
.IP "\fB--amend\fR"
Release a revision by amending the latest commit instead of making a new one\.
.IP "\fB--squash\fR \fInum\fR"
Release a revision by squashing the specified number of previous commits and
then amending the result\. Requires the \fB--amend\fR option to be specified\.
.IP "\fB--alpha\fR"
Release an alpha instead of the final version\.
.IP "\fB--beta\fR"
Release a beta version instead of the final version\.
.IP "\fB--minor\fR"
Release the next minor version instead of the current patch\.
.IP "\fB--major\fR"
Release the next major version instead of the current minor or patch\.
.IP "\fB--open-beta\fR"
Open the development cycle with the next beta version\.
.IP "\fB--open-patch\fR"
Open the development cycle with the next patch version\. This is the default
if the current patch version is not 0\fR (bugfix release series)\.
.IP "\fB--open-minor\fR"
Open the development cycle with the next minor version\. This is the default
if the current patch version is 0\fR (feature release series)\.
.IP "\fB--open-major\fR"
Open the development cycle with the next major version\.
.IP "\fB--open-base\fR \fIversion\fR"
Open the development cycle with the specified version\. The base version
should be in the \fImajor\fR\fB\.\fR\fIminor\fR\.\fR\fIpatch\fR\fR form with
the opened version becoming
\fImajor\fR\fB\.\fR\fIminor\fR\fB\.\fR\fIpatch\fR\fB-a\.0\.z\fR\fR\.
.IP "\fB--edit\fR"
Open the commit message for editing\.
.IP "\fB--no-edit\fR"
Don't open the commit message for editing\.
.IP "\fB--force\fR \fIcheck\fR"
