.SH NAME
\fBbpkg-pkg-status\fR \- print package status
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBbpkg pkg-status\fR|\fBstatus\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
[\fIpkg\fR[\fB/\fR\fIver\fR]\.\.\.]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBpkg-status\fR command prints the status of the specified packages or,
if \fIver\fR is specified, package versions\. If no packages were specified,
then \fBpkg-status\fR prints the status of all the held packages (which are
the packages that were explicitly built; see \fBbpkg-pkg-build(1)\fP)\.
Additionally, the status of immediate or all dependencies of the above
packages can be printed by specifying the \fB--immediate\fR|\fB-i\fR\fR or
\fB--recursive\fR|\fB-r\fR\fR options, respectively\. Note that the status is
written to \fBstdout\fR, not \fBstderr\fR\.
.PP
The status output format is regular with components separated with spaces\.
Each line starts with the package name (and version, if specified) followed by
one of the status words listed below\.  Some of them can be optionally
followed by '\fB,\fR' (no spaces) and a sub-status word\.
.IP "\fBunknown\fR"
.br
Package is not part of the configuration nor available from any of the
repositories\.
.IP "\fBavailable\fR"
.br
Package is not part of the configuration but is available from one of the
repositories\.
.IP "\fBfetched\fR"
.br
Package is part of the configuration and is fetched\.
.IP "\fBunpacked\fR"
.br
Package is part of the configuration and is unpacked\.
.IP "\fBconfigured\fR"
.br
Package is part of the configuration and is configured\. May be followed by
the \fBsystem\fR sub-status indicating a package coming from the system\. The
version of such a system package (described below) may be the special
\&'\fB*\fR' value indicating a wildcard version\.
.IP "\fBbroken\fR"
.br
Package is part of the configuration and is broken (broken packages can only
be purged; see \fBbpkg-pkg-purge(1)\fP)\.
.PP
If only the package name was specified without the package version, then the
\fBavailable\fR status word is followed by the list of available versions\.
Versions that are only available for up/down-grading are printed in '\fB[]\fR'
(such version are only available as dependencies from prerequisite
repositories of other repositories)\. If the \fB--system\fR option is
specified, then the last version in this list may have the \fBsys:\fR prefix
indicating an available system version\. Such a system version may be the
special '\fB?\fR' value indicating that a package may or may not be available
from the system and that its version is unknown\.
.PP
Similarly, if only the package name was specified, then the \fBfetched\fR,
\fBunpacked\fR, \fBconfigured\fR, and \fBbroken\fR status words are followed
by the version of the package\. If newer versions are available, then the
package version is followed by the \fBavailable\fR status word and the list of
newer versions\. To instead see a list of all versions, including the older
ones, specify the \fB--old-available\fR|\fB-o\fR\fR option\. In this case the
currently selected version is printed in '\fB()\fR'\.
.PP
If the package name was specified with the version, then only the status (such
as, \fBconfigured\fR, \fBavailable\fR, etc\.) of this version is considered\.
.PP
If a package is being held, then its name is printed prefixed with '\fB!\fR'\.
Similarly, if a package version is being held, then the version is printed
prefixed with '\fB!\fR'\. Held packages and held versions were selected by the
user and are not automatically dropped and upgraded, respectively\.
.PP
Below are some examples, assuming the configuration has \fBlibfoo\fR
\fB1\.0\.0\fR configured and held (both package and version) as well as
\fBlibfoo\fR \fB1\.1\.0\fR and \fB1\.1\.1\fR available from source and
\fB1\.1\.0\fR from the system\.
.PP
.nf
bpkg status libbar
libbar unknown

bpkg status libbar/1\.0\.0
libbar/1\.0\.0 unknown

bpkg status libfoo/1\.0\.0
!libfoo/1\.0\.0 configured !1\.0\.0

bpkg status libfoo/1\.1\.0
libfoo/1\.1\.0 available 1\.1\.0

bpkg status --system libfoo/1\.1\.0
libfoo/1\.1\.0 available 1\.1\.0 sys:1\.1\.0

bpkg status libfoo
!libfoo configured !1\.0\.0 available 1\.1\.0 1\.1\.1

bpkg status libfoo/1\.1\.1 libbar
libfoo/1\.1\.1 available 1\.1\.1
libbar unknown
.fi
.PP
Assuming now that we dropped \fBlibfoo\fR from the configuration:
.PP
.nf
bpkg status libfoo/1\.0\.0
libfoo/1\.0\.0 unknown

bpkg status libfoo
libfoo available 1\.1\.0 1\.1\.1
.fi
.PP
And assuming now that we built \fBlibfoo\fR as a system package with the
wildcard version:
.PP
.nf
bpkg status libfoo
!libfoo configured,system * available 1\.1\.0 1\.1\.1
.fi
