.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBpublish\fR command publishes the project packages to an archive-based
repository\.
.PP
If no project or package directory is specified, then the current working
directory is assumed\. If no configuration is specified, then the default
configuration is used to prepare the package distributions\. If the specified
directory is a project directory, then all the packages in the project are
published\. See \fBbdep-projects-configs(1)\fP for details on specifying
projects and configurations\.
.PP
For each specified package the \fBpublish\fR command prepares a package
archive and sends it as part of the package submission request to an
archive-based repository\. If the repository is not explicitly specified with
the \fB--repository\fR option, packages are published to \fBcppget\.org\fR by
default\.
.PP
Along with the package archive, the submission request specifies the
repository section to publish the package under, the control repository URL to
use for authorization, and the publisher's name and email address for the
record\. While the exact usage and interpretation of this information depends
on the specific repository, the following semantics apply when submitting to
\fBcppget\.org\fR\.
.PP
The section specifies the desired repository section to publish the project
under\. If not explicitly specified with the \fB--section\fR option, one of
the \fBalpha\fR, \fBbeta\fR, or \fBstable\fR values are automatically derived
from the package version\.
.PP
The control repository URL is a publicly accessible, read-only URL to a
version control repository (normally the same as the project's) that is used
to authenticate the publisher as someone authorized to publish under this
package name (currently only \fBgit(1)\fR is supported)\.
.PP
Prior to sending the submission request, the \fBpublish\fR command adds the
package archive checksum to the \fBbuild2-control\fR branch of the project's
version control repository\. Upon receiving the submission request, the
archive repository either (1) associates the control repository with the
package name if this is the first time this package name is published or (2)
compares the submitted control repository to the previously associated and, if
matching, queries the \fBbuild2-control\fR branch to verify that the submitter
is authorized to publish this archive under this package name\.
.PP
Unless the control repository URL is specified with the \fB--control\fR
option, it will be automatically derived from the version control's "remote"
URL\. In case of \fBgit(1)\fR, it will be based on the
\fBremote\.origin\.url\fR configuration value unless overridden with
\fBremote\.origin\.build2ControlUrl\fR or \fBremote\.origin\.build2Url\fR\.
The special \fBnone\fR value to the \fB--control\fR option can be used to
disable this functionality\.
.PP
See Package Submission (#submit) for details on the submission request
handling by archive repositories\.

.SH "DEFAULT OPTIONS FILES"
.PP
See \fBbdep-default-options-files(1)\fP for an overview of the default options
files\. For the \fBpublish\fR command the search start directory is the
project directory\. The following options files are searched for in each

.PP
.nf
bdep\.options
bdep-publish\.options

.PP
The following \fBpublish\fR command options cannot be specified in the default
