.SH NAME
\fBbpkg-pkg-unpack\fR \- unpack package archive
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBbpkg pkg-unpack\fR [\fIoptions\fR] (\fIpkg\fR[\fB/\fR\fIver\fR] |
\fB--existing|-e\fR \fIdir\fR)\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
If only the package name is specified, then the \fBpkg-unpack\fR command
unpacks the archive for the previously fetched (\fBbpkg-pkg-fetch(1)\fP)
package\. The resulting package state is \fBunpacked\fR
(\fBbpkg-pkg-status(1)\fP)\.
.PP
If the package version is also specified, then the (source) directory from one
of the directory-based repositories (\fBbpkg-rep-add(1)\fP) is used in place,
without copying it into the configuration directory\. Such a package is called
\fIexternal\fR\.
.PP
If the \fB--existing|-e\fR option is used, then instead of the package name,
\fBpkg-unpack\fR expects a local path to an existing package directory\. In
this case, \fBbpkg\fR will use the (source) directory in place, the same as
for packages from directory-based repositories\. Also, unless the
\fB--purge|-p\fR option is specified, \fBbpkg\fR will not attempt to remove
this directory when the package is later purged with the
\fBbpkg-pkg-purge(1)\fP command\. Such a package is also \fIexternal\fR\.
.PP
If \fB--existing|-e\fR is specified together with the \fB--replace|-r\fR
option, then \fBpkg-unpack\fR will replace the archive and/or source directory
of a package that is already in the \fBunpacked\fR or \fBfetched\fR state\.
.PP
An external package triggers several changes in semantics compared to a normal
package: The package (output) directory inside the configuration is called
just \fIpkg\fR rather than \fIpkg\fR\fB-\fR\fIver\fR\. It is also assumed that
the packaging information (package manifest and lockfile) for such packages
may change without incrementing the package version (for example, during
development)\. To support this, \fBbpkg\fR implements the \fIpackage
iteration\fR mechanism which may result in iteration numbers to be shown as
part of the package version, for example, \fB1\.2\.3#1\fR (see Package Version
(#package-version))\.
