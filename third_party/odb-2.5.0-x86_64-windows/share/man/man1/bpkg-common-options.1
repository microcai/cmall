\fBbpkg-common-options\fR \- details on common options
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBbpkg\fR [\fIcommon-options\fR] \.\.\.\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The common options control behavior that is common to all or most of the
\fBbpkg\fR commands\. They can be specified either before the command or
after, together with the command-specific options\.
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB-v\fR"
Print essential underlying commands being executed\. This is equivalent to
\fB--verbose 2\fR\.
.IP "\fB-V\fR"
Print all underlying commands being executed\. This is equivalent to
\fB--verbose 3\fR\.
.IP "\fB--quiet\fR|\fB-q\fR"
Run quietly, only printing error messages\. This is equivalent to \fB--verbose
0\fR\.
.IP "\fB--verbose\fR \fIlevel\fR"
Set the diagnostics verbosity to \fIlevel\fR between 0 and 6\. Level 0
disables any non-error messages while level 6 produces lots of information,
with level 1 being the default\. The following additional types of diagnostics
are produced at each level:
.RS
.IP 1. 4em
High-level information messages\.
.IP 2. 4em
Essential underlying commands being executed\.
.IP 3. 4em
All underlying commands being executed\.
.IP 4. 4em
Information that could be helpful to the user\.
.IP 5. 4em
Information that could be helpful to the developer\.
.IP 6. 4em
Even more detailed information\.
.RE
.IP "\fB--jobs\fR|\fB-j\fR \fInum\fR"
Number of jobs to perform in parallel\. If this option is not specified or
specified with the 0\fR value, then the number of available hardware threads
is used\. This option is also propagated when performing build system
operations such as \fBupdate\fR, \fBtest\fR, etc\.
.IP "\fB--no-result\fR"
Don't print informational messages about the outcome of performing a command\.
.IP "\fB--no-progress\fR"
Suppress progress indicators for long-lasting operations, such as network
transfers, building, etc\.
.IP "\fB--build\fR \fIpath\fR"
The build program to be used to build packages\. This should be the path to
the build2 \fBb\fR executable\. You can also specify additional options that
should be passed to the build program with \fB--build-option\fR\.

If the build program is not explicitly specified, then \fBbpkg\fR will by
default use \fBb\fR plus an executable suffix if one was specified when
building \fBbpkg\fR\. So, for example, if \fBbpkg\fR name was set to
\fBbpkg-1\.0\fR, then it will look for \fBb-1\.0\fR\.
.IP "\fB--build-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the build program\. See \fB--build\fR for
more information on the build program\. Repeat this option to specify multiple
build options\.
.IP "\fB--fetch\fR \fIpath\fR"
The fetch program to be used to download resources\. Currently, \fBbpkg\fR
recognizes \fBcurl\fR, \fBwget\fR, and \fBfetch\fR\. Note that the last
component of \fIpath\fR must contain one of these names as a substring in
order for \fBbpkg\fR to recognize which program is being used\. You can also
specify additional options that should be passed to the fetch program with
\fB--fetch-option\fR\.

If the fetch program is not specified, then \fBbpkg\fR will try to discover if
one of the above programs is available and use that\. Currently, \fBbpkg\fR
has the following preference order: \fBwget\fR 1\.16 or higher (supports
\fB--show-progress\fR), \fBcurl\fR, \fBwget\fR, and \fBfetch\fR\.
.IP "\fB--fetch-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the fetch program\. See \fB--fetch\fR for
more information on the fetch program\. Repeat this option to specify multiple
fetch options\.
.IP "\fB--fetch-timeout\fR \fIsec\fR"
The fetch and fetch-like (for example, \fBgit\fR) program timeout\. While the
exact semantics of the value depends on the program used, at a minimum it
specifies in seconds the maximum time that can be spent without any network
activity\.

Specifically, it is translated to the \fB--max-time\fR option for \fBcurl\fR
and to the \fB--timeout\fR option for \fBwget\fR and \fBfetch\fR\. For
\fBgit\fR over HTTP/HTTPS this semantics is achieved using the
\fBhttp\.lowSpeedLimit\fR=\fI1\fR \fBhttp\.lowSpeedTime\fR=\fIsec\fR
configuration values (the \fBgit://\fR and \fBssh://\fR protocols currently do
not support timeouts)\.

See \fB--fetch\fR and \fB--git\fR for more information on the fetch programs\.
.IP "\fB--pkg-proxy\fR \fIurl\fR"
HTTP proxy server to use when fetching package manifests and archives from
remote \fBpkg\fR repositories\. If specified, the proxy \fIurl\fR must be in
the \fBhttp://\fR\fIhost\fR[\fB:\fR\fIport\fR]\fR form\. If \fIport\fR is
omitted, 80 is used by default\.

Note that to allow caching, the proxied \fBhttps://\fR URLs are converted to
\fBhttp://\fR in order to prevent the fetch program from tunneling (which is
the standard approach for proxying HTTPS)\. If both HTTP and HTTPS
repositories are used, it is assumed that the proxy server can figure out
which URLs need to be converted back to \fBhttps://\fR based on the request
information (for example, host name)\. For security, this mechanism should
only be used with signed repositories or when the proxy is located inside a
trusted network\.
.IP "\fB--git\fR \fIpath\fR"
The git program to be used to fetch git repositories\. You can also specify
additional options that should be passed to the git program with
\fB--git-option\fR\.

If the git program is not explicitly specified, then \fBbpkg\fR will use
\fBgit\fR by default\.
.IP "\fB--git-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional common option to be passed to the git program\. Note that the
common options are the ones that precede the \fBgit\fR command\. See
\fB--git\fR for more information on the git program\. Repeat this option to
specify multiple git options\.
.IP "\fB--sha256\fR \fIpath\fR"
The sha256 program to be used to calculate SHA256 sums\. Currently, \fBbpkg\fR
recognizes \fBsha256\fR, \fBsha256sum\fR, and \fBshasum\fR\. Note that the
last component of \fIpath\fR must contain one of these names as a substring in
order for \fBbpkg\fR to recognize which program is being used\. You can also
specify additional options that should be passed to the sha256 program with
\fB--sha256-option\fR\.

If the sha256 program is not specified, then \fBbpkg\fR will try to discover
if one of the above programs is available and use that\. Currently, \fBbpkg\fR
has the following preference order: \fBsha256\fR, \fBsha256sum\fR, and
\fBshasum\fR\.
.IP "\fB--sha256-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the sha256 program\. See \fB--sha256\fR for
more information on the sha256 program\. Repeat this option to specify
multiple sha256 options\.
.IP "\fB--tar\fR \fIpath\fR"
The tar program to be used to extract package archives\. For example,
\fBgtar\fR or \fBbsdtar\fR\. You can also specify additional options that
should be passed to the tar program with \fB--tar-option\fR\. If the tar
program is not explicitly specified, then \fBbpkg\fR will use \fBtar\fR by
default\.
.IP "\fB--tar-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the tar program\. See \fB--tar\fR for more
information on the tar program\. Repeat this option to specify multiple tar
options\.
.IP "\fB--openssl\fR \fIpath\fR"
The openssl program to be used for crypto operations\. You can also specify
additional options that should be passed to the openssl program with
\fB--openssl-option\fR\. If the openssl program is not explicitly specified,
then \fBbpkg\fR will use \fBopenssl\fR by default\.

The \fB--openssl*\fR values can be optionally qualified with the openssl
command in the \fIcommand\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR\fR form\. This makes the value
only applicable to the specific command, for example:

.nf
bpkg rep-create                     \\
  --openssl rsautl:/path/to/openssl \\
  --openssl-option rsautl:-engine   \\
  --openssl-option rsautl:pkcs11    \\
  \.\.\.
.fi

An unqualified value that contains a colon can be specified as qualified with
an empty command, for example, \fB--openssl :C:\ebin\eopenssl\fR\. To see
openssl commands executed by \fBbpkg\fR, use the verbose mode (\fB-v\fR
option)\.
.IP "\fB--openssl-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the openssl program\. See \fB--openssl\fR
for more information on the openssl program\. The values can be optionally
qualified with the openssl command, as discussed in \fB--openssl\fR\. Repeat
this option to specify multiple openssl options\.
.IP "\fB--auth\fR \fItype\fR"
Types of repositories to authenticate\. Valid values for this option are
\fBnone\fR, \fBremote\fR, \fBall\fR\. By default only remote repositories are
authenticated\. You can request authentication of local repositories by
passing \fBall\fR or disable authentication completely by passing \fBnone\fR\.
.IP "\fB--trust\fR \fIfingerprint\fR"
Trust repository certificate with a SHA256 \fIfingerprint\fR\. Such a
certificate is trusted automatically, without prompting the user for a
confirmation\. Repeat this option to trust multiple certificates\.

Note that by default \fBopenssl\fR prints a SHA1 fingerprint and to obtain a
SHA256 one you will need to pass the \fB-sha256\fR option, for example:

.nf
openssl x509 -sha256 -fingerprint -noout -in cert\.pem
.fi
.IP "\fB--trust-yes\fR"
Assume the answer to all authentication prompts is \fByes\fR\.
.IP "\fB--trust-no\fR"
Assume the answer to all authentication prompts is \fBno\fR\.
.IP "\fB--pager\fR \fIpath\fR"
The pager program to be used to show long text\. Commonly used pager programs
are \fBless\fR and \fBmore\fR\. You can also specify additional options that
should be passed to the pager program with \fB--pager-option\fR\. If an empty
string is specified as the pager program, then no pager will be used\. If the
pager program is not explicitly specified, then \fBbpkg\fR will try to use
\fBless\fR\. If it is not available, then no pager will be used\.
.IP "\fB--pager-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the pager program\. See \fB--pager\fR for
more information on the pager program\. Repeat this option to specify multiple
pager options\.
.IP "\fB--options-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Read additional options from \fIfile\fR\. Each option should appear on a
separate line optionally followed by space or equal sign (\fB=\fR) and an
option value\. Empty lines and lines starting with \fB#\fR are ignored\.
Option values can be enclosed in double (\fB"\fR) or single (\fB'\fR) quotes
to preserve leading and trailing whitespaces as well as to specify empty
values\. If the value itself contains trailing or leading quotes, enclose it
with an extra pair of quotes, for example \fB'"x"'\fR\. Non-leading and
non-trailing quotes are interpreted as being part of the option value\.

The semantics of providing options in a file is equivalent to providing the
same set of options in the same order on the command line at the point where
the \fB--options-file\fR option is specified except that the shell escaping
and quoting is not required\. Repeat this option to specify more than one
options file\.
.IP "\fB--default-options\fR \fIdir\fR"
The directory to load additional default options files from\.
.IP "\fB--no-default-options\fR"
Don't load default options files\.
