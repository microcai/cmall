.SH NAME
\fBbdep-common-options\fR \- details on common options
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBbdep\fR [\fIcommon-options\fR] \.\.\.\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The common options control behavior that is common to all or most of the
\fBbdep\fR commands\. They can be specified either before the command or
after, together with the command-specific options\.
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB-v\fR"
Print essential underlying commands being executed\. This is equivalent to
\fB--verbose 2\fR\.
.IP "\fB-V\fR"
Print all underlying commands being executed\. This is equivalent to
\fB--verbose 3\fR\.
.IP "\fB--quiet\fR|\fB-q\fR"
Run quietly, only printing error messages\. This is equivalent to \fB--verbose
0\fR\.
.IP "\fB--verbose\fR \fIlevel\fR"
Set the diagnostics verbosity to \fIlevel\fR between 0 and 6\. Level 0
disables any non-error messages while level 6 produces lots of information,
with level 1 being the default\. The following additional types of diagnostics
are produced at each level:
.RS
.IP 1. 4em
High-level information messages\.
.IP 2. 4em
Essential underlying commands being executed\.
.IP 3. 4em
All underlying commands being executed\.
.IP 4. 4em
Information that could be helpful to the user\.
.IP 5. 4em
Information that could be helpful to the developer\.
.IP 6. 4em
Even more detailed information\.
.RE
.IP "\fB--jobs\fR|\fB-j\fR \fInum\fR"
Number of jobs to perform in parallel\. If this option is not specified or
specified with the 0\fR value, then the number of available hardware threads
is used\. This option is also propagated when executing package manager
commands such as \fBbpkg-pkg-update(1)\fP, \fBbpkg-pkg-test(1)\fP, etc\.,
which in turn propagate it to the build system\.
.IP "\fB--no-progress\fR"
Suppress progress indicators for long-lasting operations, such as network
transfers, building, etc\.
.IP "\fB--bpkg\fR \fIpath\fR"
The package manager program to be used for build configuration management\.
This should be the path to the \fBbpkg\fR executable\. You can also specify
additional options that should be passed to the package manager program with
\fB--bpkg-option\fR\.

If the package manager program is not explicitly specified, then \fBbdep\fR
will by default use \fBbpkg\fR plus an executable suffix if one was specified
when building \fBbdep\fR\. So, for example, if \fBbdep\fR name was set to
\fBbdep-1\.0\fR, then it will look for \fBbpkg-1\.0\fR\.
.IP "\fB--bpkg-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the package manager program\. See
\fB--bpkg\fR for more information on the package manager program\. Repeat this
option to specify multiple package manager options\.
.IP "\fB--build\fR \fIpath\fR"
The build program to be used to build packages\. This should be the path to
the build2 \fBb\fR executable\. You can also specify additional options that
should be passed to the build program with \fB--build-option\fR\.

If the build program is not explicitly specified, then \fBbdep\fR will by
default use \fBb\fR plus an executable suffix if one was specified when
building \fBbdep\fR\. So, for example, if \fBbdep\fR name was set to
\fBbdep-1\.0\fR, then it will look for \fBb-1\.0\fR\.
.IP "\fB--build-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the build program\. See \fB--build\fR for
more information on the build program\. Repeat this option to specify multiple
build options\.
.IP "\fB--curl\fR \fIpath\fR"
The curl program to be used for network operations\. You can also specify
additional options that should be passed to the curl program with
\fB--curl-option\fR\.

If the curl program is not explicitly specified, then \fBbdep\fR will use
\fBcurl\fR by default\.
.IP "\fB--curl-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the curl program\. See \fB--curl\fR for more
information on the curl program\. Repeat this option to specify multiple curl
options\.
.IP "\fB--pager\fR \fIpath\fR"
The pager program to be used to show long text\. Commonly used pager programs
are \fBless\fR and \fBmore\fR\. You can also specify additional options that
should be passed to the pager program with \fB--pager-option\fR\. If an empty
string is specified as the pager program, then no pager will be used\. If the
pager program is not explicitly specified, then \fBbdep\fR will try to use
\fBless\fR\. If it is not available, then no pager will be used\.
.IP "\fB--pager-option\fR \fIopt\fR"
Additional option to be passed to the pager program\. See \fB--pager\fR for
more information on the pager program\. Repeat this option to specify multiple
pager options\.
.IP "\fB--options-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Read additional options from \fIfile\fR\. Each option should appear on a
separate line optionally followed by space or equal sign (\fB=\fR) and an
option value\. Empty lines and lines starting with \fB#\fR are ignored\.
Option values can be enclosed in double (\fB"\fR) or single (\fB'\fR) quotes
to preserve leading and trailing whitespaces as well as to specify empty
values\. If the value itself contains trailing or leading quotes, enclose it
with an extra pair of quotes, for example \fB'"x"'\fR\. Non-leading and
non-trailing quotes are interpreted as being part of the option value\.

The semantics of providing options in a file is equivalent to providing the
same set of options in the same order on the command line at the point where
the \fB--options-file\fR option is specified except that the shell escaping
and quoting is not required\. Repeat this option to specify more than one
options file\.
.IP "\fB--default-options\fR \fIdir\fR"
The directory to load additional default options files from\.
.IP "\fB--no-default-options\fR"
Don't load default options files\.
