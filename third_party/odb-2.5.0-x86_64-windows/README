This package contains build2 toolchain base utilities (diff, install, tar,
etc) for Windows. Often the build2 toolchain itself is installed into this
same directory in order to produce a combined build2+utilities installation.
If you don't have a suitable C++ compiler already installed, then you can
use the companion build2-mingw package.

The utilities come from the MSYS2 distribution. For details, refer to the
manifest and version files found in the usr\share\doc\ subdirectory of this
package. For more information on build2 see:

https://build2.org/

To install, simply unpack the archive. The utilities reside in the bin\ sub-
directory and are ready to use. You may also want to add bin\ to the PATH
environment variable for easier access. For example, you can unpack the
archive in C:\, rename the resulting directory to build2-baseutils\ (or
build2\ if you plan to install the build2 toolchain into it) and add
C:\build2-baseutils\bin\ to PATH.
