This package contains a minimal MinGW-W64 distribution (gcc, g++, runtime) for
the build2 toolchain. Its primary use is to build the build2 toolchain in case
you don't have a suitable C++ compiler already installed. It is meant to be
extracted into the same directory as the build2-baseutils package.

The files come from the MSYS2 distribution. For details, refer to the manifest
and version files found in the usr\share\doc\ subdirectory of this package.
For more information on build2 see:

https://build2.org/

To install, first unpack the baseutils package. Then use the provided tar and
xz utilities to extract this archive into the same directory. For example, if
baseutils are in C:\build2\, then (from the command prompt):

set PATH=C:\build2\bin;%PATH%
tar xf build2-mingw-X.Y.Z-<ARCH>-windows.tar.xz ^
--one-top-level=C:\build2 ^
--strip-components=1
