# By default MSYS2 mounts /bin as /usr/bin but in our setup we moved /usr/bin
# to /bin. If we don't correct this then none of the MSYS2 programs will be
# able to execute anything from /bin since they "see" it as empty. So this
# entry essentially cancel the MSYS2 default mount. It works because bind
# immediately resolves the "device" path to its Win32 equivalent. So what we
# end up with is a mount of something like C:/utils/bin to /bin.

# installed files to be inaccessible by other users and noacl no longer
# seem to cause any issues.
